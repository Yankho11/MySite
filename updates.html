              <ul>
                  <li>Added video showcasing dynamic lighting in Helix and free camera</li>
                  <br>
                  It's me, back again with another update
                  <br>(I actually had one ready at the beginning of this month because I planned to do updates bi-weekly
                  <br>but unfortunately I couldn't find the time and in the chaose I broke the engine, but here we are).
                  <br>So I've been working on getting dynamic lighting into the engine but that got halted when I accidentally
                  <br>broke the camera systems for the engine. Things were kind of all over the show with the original build of the helix
                  <br>and in my attempt to get things into the engine quickly due to my lack of time, I ended up breaking the camera instead
                  <br>making rendering unpredictable. I kinda got defeated by this and just didn't touch the engine for a while, but after
                  <br>coming accross some free time and playing some games I remembered why I love compputer graphics and decided to reuild
                  <br>the engine from scratch modularising/factorising things out as effectively as possible while trying to cater to performance
                  <br>and resource allocation. The final result of 2 weeks of work is all in the uploaded video. I actualy do have a texture loader
                  <br>set up in the engine as well and I'll upload a video showcasing that as well.
                  <p>

                      <span style="font-weight: bold;">What's next for Helix?</span>
                      <br>As of now I'm planning on adding the ability select different materials for objects as well as setting up
                      <br>HDR.

                <h4 style="font-weight: bold;">Updated - 15 May 2024</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Added a seperate page for Helix(the graphics software, not the site)</li>
                    <br>
                    After much deliberation, I finally dcided to start working on the graphics engine.
                    <br> This wasn't an easy decision to make due to the time complexity of these kinds 
                    <br>of software, but this has always been a dream of mine so I thought, 
                    <br>"If not now, then when?". This will be a very slow project as I would still be 
                    <br>learning some things whilst working on the the engine and thus updates to it's 
                    <br>state would also be slow.
                    <p>
                        <br>
                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">What's next for Helix?</span>
                        <br>
                        The next features it'll get are, texture mapping and lighting, but in relation to its showcasing,
                        <br>as of now, I chose to make a seperate page on this site just for it because I would like 
                        <br>to showcase as much of it as possible, plus these kinds of projects usually have many features, 
                        <br>so giving it its own page was the best decision I believe. Once the project gets larger, I do 
                        <br>intend on moving its showcase and related data to its own seperate site. 
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        Added update log page
                    </li>
                    <br>
                        I added this page in order to help keep track of the changes this site has undergone 
                        <br>throughout its life cycle.
                </ul>
