                So before diving into the updates, let me explain what the current state of the website is.....if I had to user
                1 word, that would be an easy pick, the word would be mess.
                <br>The website right now is clunky, things are everywhere and nothing is properly factored in or out,
                but hopefully I will be able to set some time aside in order to first,
                <br>sort out the filing system of the site, then 
                hopefully start redesigning it.
                <br>While I am aware that I dont have much of an eye for design, I am looking to improve the site,
                and one day hopefully have everything be eye catching

                <h4 style="font-weight: bold;">Updates - 15 May 2024</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Added a seperate page for Helix(the graphics software, not the site)</li>
                    <br>
                    After much deliberation, I finally dcided to start working on the graphics engine.
                    <br> This wasn't an easy decision to make due to the time complexity of these kinds 
                    <br>of software, but this has always been a dream of mine so I thought, 
                    <br>"If not now, then when?". This will be a very slow project as I would still be 
                    <br>learning some things whilst working on the the engine and thus updates to it's 
                    <br>state would also be slow.
                    <p>
                        <br>
                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">What's next for Helix?</span>
                        <br>
                        The next features it'll get are, texture mapping and lighting, but in relation to its showcasing,
                        <br>as of now, I chose to make a seperate page on this site just for it because I would like 
                        <br>to showcase as much of it as possible, plus these kinds of projects usually have many features, 
                        <br>so giving it its own page was the best decision I believe. Once the project gets larger, I do 
                        <br>intend on moving its showcase and related data to its own seperate site. 
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        Added update log page
                    </li>
                    <br>
                        I added this page in order to help keep track of the changes this site has undergone 
                        <br>throughout its life cycle.
