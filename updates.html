            <ul>
                <li>Added videos showcasing point and spot lights</li>
                <br> I had some down time this week and decideed to just get some more lighting variety in engine first. This was actually finished last week sunday but because life
                is unpredictable, I'm only updating it today.
                <br>What's new is that you can now select different types of light sources and I added videos showcasing the remaining 2 light types (point and spot lights).
                <br>I do intend to make improvements to the lighting system, but for now I just want to get basic engine capabilities up and running.
                  <p>
                    <br>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">What's next for Helix?</span>
                    <br>Pretty much the same goal as stated in the previous update, getting a gui in and an object loader.

            <ul>
                <li>Added videos showcasing emission maps</li>
                <br>Back with another update. I know I said I would be updating the site every 2 weeks but unfortunately that seems
                <br>to be getting more and more challenging. So I wil be changing the schedule to be monthly instead (Hopefully this will be the last schedule change).
                <br>That aside, as the heading of the update states, I've been working on emission maps. I wanted there to be at least 1 new feature added for this update
                <br>since it's been a month and half since the last one(even though I said I wasn't going to add anything).
                <br>Apart from the emission maps, most of the past month and a half has been spent juggling between work and restructuring the engine, hence only emission maps
                <br> were added, But I have come accross some free time right now and I'll try to see how far I can get.

                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">What's next for Helix?</span>
                    <br>Next on the agenda is the texture loader adn then a GUI.
                    <br>That's all I have for this one, see you guys in the next update

            <ul>
                <li>Added videos showcasing specular lighting, directional lighting, real time directional lighting and materials(metal specifically)</li>
                <br>
                I'm back with another update, unfortunately this one wil be rushed due to a lack of time.....
                <br>As the title of this update states, I've added videos which will showcase lighting and all the different types
                <br>of lighting components which aid in making a scene seem more realistic, as well as the different material types.
                <br>With regards to the materials, I only uploaded the ones showcasing reflective materials, but I do have ones for
                <br> rubber, plastic, snow and some precious stones, those will be uploaded at a later date, probably when time isn't 
                <br>as expensive.

                    <br>For now I'm not going to add anything new, because I want to clean up the code. 
                    <br>The next update may come at during the second week of august(maybe sooner?I don't know, time is a rare commodity right now), cheers until then.

              <ul>
                  <li>Added video showcasing dynamic lighting in Helix and free camera</li>
                  <br>
                  It's me, back again with another update
                  <br>(I actually had one ready at the beginning of this month because I planned to do updates bi-weekly
                  <br>but unfortunately I couldn't find the time and in the chaose I broke the engine, but here we are).
                  <br>So I've been working on getting dynamic lighting into the engine but that got halted when I accidentally
                  <br>broke the camera systems for the engine. Things were kind of all over the show with the original build of the helix
                  <br>and in my attempt to get things into the engine quickly due to my lack of time, I ended up breaking the camera instead
                  <br>making rendering unpredictable. I kinda got defeated by this and just didn't touch the engine for a while, but after
                  <br>coming accross some free time and playing some games I remembered why I love compputer graphics and decided to reuild
                  <br>the engine from scratch modularising/factorising things out as effectively as possible while trying to cater to performance
                  <br>and resource allocation. The final result of 2 weeks of work is all in the uploaded video. I actualy do have a texture loader
                  <br>set up in the engine as well and I'll upload a video showcasing that as well.

                      <br>As of now I'm planning on adding the ability select different materials for objects as well as setting up
                      <br>HDR.

                <ul>
                    <li>Added a seperate page for Helix(the graphics software, not the site)</li>
                    <br>
                    After much deliberation, I finally dcided to start working on the graphics engine.
                    <br> This wasn't an easy decision to make due to the time complexity of these kinds 
                    <br>of software, but this has always been a dream of mine so I thought, 
                    <br>"If not now, then when?". This will be a very slow project as I would still be 
                    <br>learning some things whilst working on the the engine and thus updates to it's 
                    <br>state would also be slow.
                    <p>

                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">What's next for Helix?</span>
                        <br>
                        The next features it'll get are, texture mapping and lighting, but in relation to its showcasing,
                        <br>as of now, I chose to make a seperate page on this site just for it because I would like 
                        <br>to showcase as much of it as possible, plus these kinds of projects usually have many features, 
                        <br>so giving it its own page was the best decision I believe. Once the project gets larger, I do 
                        <br>intend on moving its showcase and related data to its own seperate site. 
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        Added update log page
                    </li>
                    <br>
                        I added this page in order to help keep track of the changes this site has undergone 
                        <br>throughout its life cycle.
